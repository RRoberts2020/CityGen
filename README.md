This is my random WFC city generation for advance technologies, by Reece Roberts (20028474)

Launching program build:

To access the build for this project, navigate to the Build folder and click on "CityGen.exe" to start up the program.

Once program launches, the WFC will automatically construct a random map layout, depending on your computer specification,
and if the WFC has to auto-restart due to an error, this process can take between 20 seconds to 2 minutes or more.

After this process is complete more option buttons will be made avalible to you. However, 
2 option buttons will be made avliable for you to interact with regardless of what state the program is in.

Controls:

Use the mouse to click on various button options available / looking around whilst the as a playable character.
