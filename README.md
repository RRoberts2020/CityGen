Launching program build:

To access the build for this project, navigate to the Build folder and click on "CityGen.exe" to start up the program.

Once the program launches, the WFC will automatically construct a random map layout, depending on your computer specification, and if the WFC has to auto-restart due to an error, this process can take between 20 seconds to 2 minutes or more.

After this process is complete more option buttons will be made available to you. However, 2 options buttons will be made available for you to interact with regardless of what state the program is in.


Controls:

Use the mouse to click on various button options available / looking around whilst as a playable character.

W,A,S,D to move around the map whilst as a playable character.

Space bar to Jump whilst as a playable character.
